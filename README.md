**Note:** This repository is not being actively maintained due to lack of time and interest. If you maintain or know of a good fork, please let me know so I can direct future visitors to it. In the meantime, if this library isn't working, you can find a list of popular forks here: http://forked.yannick.io/mattdiamond/recorderjs.

My sincerest apologies to the open source community for allowing this project to stagnate. I hope it was useful for some of you as a jumping-off point.
